        <h1>Alpacas are Awesome</h1>
        <p>Alpacas are four legged mammals native to South America. 
            They have very soft wool that insulates well against heat.
            They are also able to carry large loads and are surefooted,
            making them great pack animals.
        </p>
        <p>
            Alpacas are commonly confused with llamas. The main difference is their size, with alpacas being noticably smaller.
            This is why Alpacas aren't used for riding the way camels are, and instead are used as pack animals in hot climates.
